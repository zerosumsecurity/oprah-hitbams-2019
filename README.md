## description

Little known fact about Oprah is that before giving away cars she used to give away flags. Encrypted with state-of-the-art crypto at the time, which looks a lot like good old DES. Connect to <b>ip</b> at <b>port</b> to get your flag and dust off your good old crypanalysis skills. 

## hint (1)

Look at the S-Boxes, they look a bit different. 

## hint (2)

The S-Boxes are the only part of DES which provide non-linearity.
